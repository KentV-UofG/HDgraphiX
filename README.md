# HDgraphiX
Code for HDX Heatmapping Website

This is built to run using Azure webhosting and Flask in python Important changes to run locally would be:

Removing references to Azure blob storage - this is where generated files are stored, this should be changed to local storage.

Flask calls for variables from an HTML template (in template file).

Remove App definitions (app routes before definitions). One can essentially copy out the code from within the generate_pdf def, ensuring dependencies are defined at top of code and all variables are set manually in the code

input_csv_file should be a path to the input files local storage location eg input_csv_file = r"C:\Users\kentv\Downloads\example HDX Data (1).csv"

Alternatively there is a seperate folder - local file. This is the original script generated by Dr. Algirdas Velyvis. It requires manual input of all values, as well as values to decide which plotting method to use. In depth explanation has been provided within the script describing what each variable is and how it should be used.

Of note, this script can not generate Woods Plots, as this was a later addition after transitioning to Azure and Flask. Additionally, this script only recognizes DynamX cluster files, and not outputs from HDeXaminer. A seperate python script has been provided to convert HDeXaminer files to DynamX.
